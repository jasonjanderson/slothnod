========

Back in 2010 I developed a Twitter content aggregator.  It contained a leaderboard of popular tweets; uniquely aggregated based on the tweet’s follower to ‘favorite’ ratio; leading to a more diverse mix of content.

SlothNod launched on September 18th, 2010 and had 200+ registered users in the first 2 days.
