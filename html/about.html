<h3>Why another twitter star aggregation site?</h3>

<p>
  Slothnod is an alternative to the predominant star aggregation sites like Favstar and pre-edited comedy sites such as Witstream. It's not for everyone, nor does it aim to be. SlothNod hopes to provide a 
  forum for newer, less-followed people, people who use Twitter in any number of less star-popular ways, people who aren't consciously writing comedy, and people with less ambition than it takes to compete for leaderboard 
  status elsewhere. Ideally, SlothNod will be a place to discover new intriguing Twitites, a place where there might be a broader variety of writing along with the people's favorite comedy, and a place where members of an
  ersatz community can chill out without so much competition, cliques, castes, clamoring for position, and other all-too-human behaviors evidenced on Favstar currently and on Favrd before that. Or so the sloth hopes.

<h3>Why SLOTHNOD? That's an awful name.</h3>
<p>
  The sloth is a slow-moving, unambitious creature. A nod is a slight move of the head indicating approval, understanding, or agreement. Having observed the rather feverish starring behavior and jockeying for position on 
  the predominant Twitter star sites for the last two years, a more relaxed, content-driven Twitter star collector seems like a decent idea. It might be a shitty idea. The sloth will see.

<h3>SlothNod language</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Blurt  =  A tweet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nod  =  A star or favorite on a tweet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nodder / SlothNodder  =  A member of SlothNod.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What makes Slothnod different?</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <b>SlothNod is opt-in:</b> We only collect nods from SlothNodders so if you want your nods collected, <a href="/signin">sign in</a>. You only have to sign into SlothNod once in order for your nods to be collected. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <b>SlothNod formula:</b> A Slothnodder's blurt will appear on the <a href="/">Nod Board</a> when s/he receives (# of followers * 0.00666) or 3 nods (whichever is greater). This levels the playing field by allowing 
    people with less followers but great content to be found.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <b>Content first:</b> All blurts containing @replies, #hashtags or URLs will not be counted. Twitter is wonderful for social interaction, sharing, marketing and circulating one's crippling crush on Justine Beaver 
    ad nauseam. SlothNod is for original, isolated blurts mailed to the ether; like an unaddressed postcard. Words. Your words. That's what matters to the sloth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Anonymous for the first day:</b> The author of a blurt will not be identified on the UTC day their blurt makes the <a href="/">Nod Board</a>. Identities will be revealed each day at 12:00AM UTC. Anonymity might be fun. Or not. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>SlothNod is slow:</b> The <a href="/">Nod Board</a> updates every 30 minutes (at :01 and :31 of every hour).
  </li>
  <li> 
    <b>No banned language:</b> It's for adults, not kids.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Number of followers:</b> SlothNod is for people with less than 31,013 followers (mmm...palindrome). SlothNod isn't for celebrities. If you have more than 31,013 followers, check out <a href="http://favstar.fm">favstar.fm</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>SlothNod is free:</b> The sloth may accept donations in the future, but we won't charge for features or access. The sloth has nothing to sell and no interest in making money. Yes, it would be nice to pay SlothNod's 
    fine devloper for the untold hours he's put into this, and maybe recover monthly hosting fees, but sloths do not concern themselves with elements of capitalism. 
  </li>
</ul>

  bots took over the last forum.)
