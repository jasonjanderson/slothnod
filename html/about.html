<h3>Why another twitter star aggregation site?</h3>

<p>
Slothnod is an alternative to the predominant star aggregation sites like Favstar and pre-edited comedy sites such as Witstream. It's not for everyone, nor does it aim to be. SlothNod especially hopes to provide a forum for newer, less-followed people, people who use Twitter in any number of less star-popular ways, people who aren't consciously writing comedy, and people with less ambition than it takes to compete for leaderboard status elsewhere. Ideally, SlothNod will be a place to discover new intriguing Twitites, a place where there might be a broader variety of writing along with the people's favorite comedy, and a place where members of am ersatz community can chill out without so much competition, cliques, castes, clamoring for position, and other all-too-human behaviors evidenced on Favstar currently and on Favrd before that. Or so the sloth hopes. Once the site is up, it will become whatever people make of it.

<h3>Why SLOTHNOD? That's an awful name.</h3>
</p>
<p>
The sloth is a slow-moving, unambitious creature. A nod is a slight move of the head indicating approval, understanding, or agreement. Having observed the rather feverish starring behavior and jockeying for position on the predominant Twitter star sites for the last two years, a more relaxed, content-driven Twitter star collector seems like a decent idea. It might be a shitty idea. The sloth will see. it depends on the people who join in.

<h3>What makes Slothnod different?</h3>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> SLOTHNOD IS AN OPT-IN FORUM. People manually sign up to join SlothNod. Nods are only collected from, and for, SlothNodders. 
</li>
  <li> CONTENT FIRST - The authors of a blurt (tweet) will not be idetnified on the day their blurt makes the SlothNod scroll. Identities will be revealed each dat at 12:00 a.m. GMT when that day's scroll (a.k.a. board) is closed. Anonymity might be fun. Or not. 
</li>
  <li> LEVEL PLAYING FIELD - SlothNod will attempt to level the social hierarchy that has slowly developed since Twitter launched, was cemented, and built upon, by the launch of Favrd (May 2008), and continued now by Favstar, the predominant Twitter site.
</li>
  <li> SIMPLE, FAIR FORMULA - A Slothnodder's blurt will appear on the scroll when s/he receives nods (stars) from 1/2 of 1 percent of their total followers plus "followings." Simple math: # of followers + # followed X .005 = SlothNod Scroll appearance.
</li>
  <li> MINIUMUM NUMBER OF SLOTH NODS (stars) TO MAKE BOARD = 3
</li>
  <li> SLOTHNOD IS AN OPT-IN FORUM. People manually sign up to join SlothNod. Nods are only collected from, and for, SlothNodders.
</li>
  <li> NO BANNED LANGUAGE. Fuck, cunt, motherfucker... All allowed. It's for adults, not kids.
</li>
  <li>*** NO BANNING PEOPLE. If a person meets Slothnod account conditions and Twitter has not banned them, individual humans will not be banned from Slothnod. (Bots are not people.) Repeat. If Twitter hasn't banned you, Slothnod won't.
</li>
  <li> SLOTHNOD WILL BE SLOW - Not in performance. (We hope.) SlothNod's system parameters will slow things down. The SlothNod formula will almost certainly slow the pace at which new blurts (tweets) appear on the daily scroll (leader board). The sloth will also launch without individual pages. When we do add individual pages, where people can view who nods to them and look up the same for other members, these pages will only be updated ONCE per day, at mindnight GMT when the daily scroll in closed and reset. The daily scroll will only update once every 30 minutes. Refreshing "ME" pages and the scroll will produce no satisfactory results for the feverish. The sloth expects this will not be popular. The sloth also expects not to care. The sloth wants to run this site on the cheap. For fun. And discovery.
</li>
  <li> NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS + FOLLOWINGS TO JOIN SLOTHNOD = LESS THAN 50,000. (We might lower this number before launch, to maybe 10,000.) SlothNod isn't for celebrities. 
</li>
  <li> ROLLING, PAGE-THROUGH LEADER SCROLL. People may scroll the scroll as long as they wish. (For days, if that's your thing.;)
</li>
  <li> FILTERED OFF SLOTHNOD SCROLL: @replies, tweets with @username (mentions), #HASHTAGS, tweets with links. Twitter is wonderful for social interaction, sharing, marketing and circulating one's crippling crush on Justine Beaver ad nauseam. The Slothnod scroll is for original, isolated blurts mailed to the ether, like an unaddressed postcard. Words. Your words. That's what matters to the sloth.
</li>
  <li> DAILY SCROLL FROM MIDNIGHT-MIDNIGHT, GMT At the close of each day, the previous dayâ€™s board and the authors revealed.
</li>
  <li> Avatars of people who nod a blurt show on the SlothNod daily scroll.
</li>
  <li> Ability to nod a blurt directly from any Slothnod page.
</li>
  <li> Leader board refreshes every 30 minutes at :01 and :31 after the hour.
  SEE THE BLOG AT <a href="http://slothnod.org/talk">http://slothnod.org/talk</a> FOR UPDATES AND DISCUSSION. Feel free to leave comments, please. (Sorry, the sloth imposed impose registration and moderation recently after spam bots took over the last forum.)
</li>
  <li> SLOTHNOD IS FREE and always will be. The sloth will accept donations, but we won't charge for features or access. The sloth has nothing to sell and no interest in making money. Yes, it would be nice to pay SlothNod's fine devloper for the untold hours he's put into this, and maybe recover monthly hosting fees, but sloths do not concern themselves with elements of capitalism. 
</li>
  <li> Slothnod MIGHT keep a public member list so people can find other Slothnodders and, frankly, so members might  police themselves, shaming a marketer, a "webcock" or a Bieber Tweeter, for instance. But the sloth doesn't want to scare anyone away who might prefer to remain less immediately visible. 
</li>
  <li> SLOTHNOD WILL BE SLOWER - Not in performance. (We hope.) SlothNod's system parameters will slow things down. The SlothNod formula will almost certainly slow the pace at which new blurts appear on the daily scroll. The sloth will also launch without individual pages. When we do add individual pages, where people can view who nods to them and look up the same for other SlothNodders, these pages will only be updated ONCE per day, at midnight GMT when the daily scroll is closed and reset. The daily scroll will only update once every 30 minut</ul>

*** The Sloth will review incoming membership applicants on occasion, contact potential false accounts (used to game the "system" by starring one's own primary account) and screen out suspicious members before accepting them. A list of members may also keep out the obvious "gamers" and encourage Slothnodders to do some self policing (if, sadly, such becomes necessary).
