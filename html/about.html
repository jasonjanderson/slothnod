<h3>Why another twitter star aggregation site?</h3> 
 
<p> 
Slothnod is an alternative to the predominant star aggregation sites and pre-edited comedic sites such as Witstream. It's not for everyone, nor does it aim to be. SlothNod especially hopes to provide a forum for newer, less-followed people, people who use twitter in any number of less star-popular ways, people who aren't consciously writing comedy, and people with less ambition than it takes to compete for leaderboard status elsewhere. Ideally, SlothNod will be a place to discover new intriguing Twitites, a place where there might be a broader variety of writing along with comedy, and a place where members of am ersatz community can chill out with the competition, clamoring for position, and other natural, all too human behaviors. Or so the sloth hopes.

<h3>Why SLOTHNOD? That's an awful name.</h3> 
</p> 

<p> 
The sloth is a slow-moving, unambitious creature. A nod is a slight move of the head indicating approval, understanding, or agreement. Having observed the rather feverish starring behavior and jockeying for position on the predominant Twitter star sites, a more relaxed, content-driven seems like a decent idea. It might be a fine place for recovering star whores and pimps to hang out, maybe take a break from the obsessive refreshing, and sundry behaviors.

<h3>What makes Slothnod different?</h3> 

<ul> 
  <li>SLOTHNOD IS AN OPT-IN FORUM. People manually sign up to join SlothNod. Nods are only collected from, and for, SlothNodders. 
  </li> <li> CONTENT FIRST - The authors of a blurt (tweet) will not be indetified on the day their blurt makes the SlothNod scroll. Identities will be revealed each dat at 12:00 a.m. GMT when that day's scroll (a.k.a. board) is closed. Anonymity might be fun. Or not. 
 </li>  <li> LEVEL PLAYING FIELD - SlothNod will attempt to level the social hierarchy that has slowly developed since Twitter launched, was cemented, and built upon, by the launch of Favrd (May 2008), and continued now by Favstar, the predominant Twitter site.
 </li>  <li> SIMPLE, FAIR FORMULA - A Slothnodder's blurt will appear on the scroll when s/he receives nods (stars) from 1/2 of 1 percent of their total followers plus "followings." Simple math: # of followers + # followed X .005 = SlothNod Scroll appearance.
  </li> <li> MINIUMUM NUMBER OF SLOTH NODS (stars) TO MAKE BOARD = 3
  </li> <li> SLOTHNOD IS AN OPT-IN FORUM. People manually sign up to join SlothNod. Nods are only collected from, and for, SlothNodders.
  </li> <li> NO BANNED LANGUAGE. Fuck, cunt, motherfucker... All allowed. It's for adults, not kids.
  </li> <li>*** NO BANNING PEOPLE. If a person meets Slothnod account conditions and Twitter has not banned them, individual humans will not be banned from Slothnod. (Bots are not people.) Repeat. If Twitter hasn't banned you, Slothnod won't.
  </li> <li> SLOTHNOD WILL BE SLOW - Not in performance. (We hope.) SlothNod's system parameters will slow things down. The SlothNod formula will almost certainly slow the pace at which new blurts (tweets) appear on the daily scroll (leader board). The sloth will also launch without individual pages. When we do add individual pages, where people can view who nods to them and look up the same for other SlothNodders, these pages will only be updated ONCE per day, at mindnight GMT when the daily scroll in closed and reset. The daily scroll will only update once every 30 minutes. Refreshing "ME" pages and the scroll will produce no satisfactory results for the feverish. The sloth expects this will not be popular. The sloth also expects not to care. The sloth wants to run this site on the cheap. For fun. And discovery.
  </li> <li> NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS + FOLLOWINGS TO JOIN SLOTHNOD = LESS THAN 50,000. SlothNod isn't for celebrities. 
  </li> <li> ROLLING, PAGE-THROUGH LEADER SCROLL. People may scroll the scroll as long as they wish. (For days, if that's your thing.;)
  </li> <li> FILTERED OFF SLOTHNOD SCROLL: @replies, tweets with @username, #HASHTAGS, tweets with links
  </li> <li> DAILY LEADERBOARD FROM MIDNIGHT-MIDNIGHT, GMT At the close of each day, the previous day.s board will be posted in order and the authors revealed.
  </li> <li> Avatars of people who nod a blurt show on the SlothNod daily scroll.
  </li> <li> Ability to nod a blurt directly from any Slothnod page.
  </li> <li> Leader board refreshes every 30 minutes at :01 and :31 after the hour.
  SEE THE BLOG AT <a href="http://slothnod.org/talk">http://slothnod.org/talk</a> FOR UPDATES AND DISCUSSION. Feel free to leave comments, please. (Sorry, the sloth imposed impose registration and moderation recently after spam bots took over the last forum.)
  </li> <li> SLOTHNOD IS FREE and always will be. The sloth will accept donations, but we won't charge for features or access. The sloth has nothing to sell and no interest in making money. Yes, it would be nice to recover monthly hosting fees and maybe pay SlothNod's fine devloper, but sloths do not concern themselves with elements of capitalism.
  </li> <li> SLOTHNOD MEMBER LIST - The sloth will maintain a public list of all members by Twitter account names.

*** The Sloth will review incoming membership applicants on occasion, contact potential false accounts (used to game the "system" by starring one's own primary account) and screen out suspicious members before accepting them. A list of members may also keep out the obvious "gamers" and encourage Slothnodders to do some self policing (if, sadly, such becomes necessary).

NOTES:
<p> 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  There will be a little sloth head icon or a, more probably, a circle. You can nod at the blurt from here by clicking the sloth head or circle icon.
      <li> 
          The sloth might have a very small "I can't wait" or "Tell me" or "I gotta know" or "I suck" link that goes straight to the otherwise anonymous blurt author's twitter page. People who won't star otuside (usually down from) their caste will use this and take all the fun of it.
              <li> 
                  Slothnod also wants to encourage discovery of, and maybe garner new followers for, newer, less widely followed, and occasional blurters. If we don't give people an option to look (ideally AFTER they've nodded the blurter OR having no intention of nodding the blurt but curious), they may not like SlothNod at all. maybe that's good.
                      <li> 
                          Blurt authors aren't revealed until 12:00 AM GMT when the Daily Leaderboard is ended and posted to the Board Archives.

                          All the other pages (About, Join/Leave, Nod Boards, Top Sloths, & Members) will look the same. If there's any difference, I'd like to shrink the header on They can keep the header
