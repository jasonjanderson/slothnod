    Welcome. Slothnod is a Twitter content aggregator of blurts selected by members of its virtual, proto-quasi-town in the innerwebz ether.

      Membership is voluntary (opt-in) and continued (opt-out) by your choice.

    Appearance of a blurt on the <a href="/">Nod Board</a> is based on this simple math: 
    <br> A Slothnodder's blurt will appear on the Nod Board when s/he receives (# of followers * <?php echo SLOTHNOD_FORMULA_MULTIPLIER; ?>) or <?php echo SLOTHNOD_FORMULA_MIN_NODS; ?> nods (whichever is greater) on 
    a blurt from <i>from fellow Slothnodders</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      All blurts containing @replies, or links are filtered out.
    </li>
    <li>
      SlothNod is NC-17 and up. It&#39;s not for children or prudes. No words are banned.
